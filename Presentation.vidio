[Slide 1: Title]

> "Hi everyone, I’m Abraham Thulei, and this is my Week 4 submission for the Power Learn Project on Building Intelligent Software Solutions."





[Slide 2: Task Overview]

> "The assignment covers theoretical analysis, practical coding, and ethical considerations of using AI in software engineering."






[Slide 3: Task 1 – Code Completion]

> "I used GitHub Copilot to generate a function that sorts a list of dictionaries. Compared to my manual code, Copilot's version was more robust, using .get() to handle missing keys."





[Slide 4: Task 2 – Test Automation]

> "Using Testim.io, I automated login testing. AI features like smart locators helped adapt to UI changes and saved time. Here’s the result screenshot."




[Slide 5: Task 3 – Predictive Analytics]

> "I trained a Random Forest model on the Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset. It achieved 96% accuracy in classifying issue priority. This simulates intelligent resource allocation in project planning."





[Slide 6: Ethical Reflection]

> "Bias in data can affect predictions. I explored how IBM AI Fairness 360 could help detect and reduce such bias, ensuring fair and inclusive software."





[Slide 7: Bonus Innovation]

> "Finally, I proposed DocuGenAI—an AI that generates documentation automatically. It helps maintain clean, readable, and well-documented codebases."





[Slide 8: Conclusion]

> "Thanks for watching! You can find my code on GitHub at Abrahamthulei. Let’s build smarter software together!
